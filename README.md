# SVM-Kernel-based-method-for-Satellite-image-Classification
This study evaluates the application of SVMs with different kernels for the classification of satellite images into four categories: Cloudy, Desert, Green Area, and Water. Several multiclass SVM classification strategies are employed: OAO, OAA, DAGSVM, WW SVM, and CS SVM. Performance is measured using the Kappa coefficient and average F-measure. The methodology includes detailed data preprocessing, parameter selection for each type of kernel, and the combination of kernel functions with different classifiers. The study explores the impact of various kernel functions (Linear, Polynomial, RBF, and Sigmoid) on the performance of SVMs. The results of this research improve land cover classification systems, which are essential for environmental monitoring and resource management.
